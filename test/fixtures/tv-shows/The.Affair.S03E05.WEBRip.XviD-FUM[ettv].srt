1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,389
Previously on The Affair...

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,849
You don't remember me, do you?

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,019
John Gunther. We've actually met.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,653
It was high school. Swim meets.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,059
And your marriage to
the ex-convict

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,689
who killed your brother-in-law.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,739
How's that going?
We're estranged.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,235
But not divorced.

9
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,819
Well, the problem is,
you seem incapable

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,029
of putting that child's needs
before your own.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,239
Don't be a monster.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,807
She is my child,

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,289
and she needs me.

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,209
Mr. Solloway,
we're treating this attack

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,579
as an attempted homicide.

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,539
Cole is definitely a person
of interest.

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,169
What about Alison Bailey?

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,089
Someone tried to fucking
kill me, and you got nothing.

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,657
I promise you,
I am punishing myself already.

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,380
Alison.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,213
You know, what you got there is
an inmate violation.

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,363
I'm gonna hang onto this
for a sec.

23
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:00,064
- Come on.
- Hey!

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,820
Fuck.

25
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,903
I'm gonna keep this nice and safe.

26
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,329
Detective Stanton,
I think I know who attacked me.

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,449
You can have Joanie on Tuesday
for her birthday.

28
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,150
Maybe your bad decisions
really are behind you.

30
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,330
Alison?

31
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,667
Can't believe
I'm actually looking at you.

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,410
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,470
I came to see you.

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,729
Thought I'd surprise you.

35
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,430
No, I... I-I can't.

36
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,593
If... if Cole finds you
out here, he'll...

37
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,120
He'll what?

38
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I can't... Alison.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,567
I got stabbed four days ago.

40
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,580
I know.

41
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,590
Sorry.

42
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,643
But I... I don't know what to do.
I can't be seen with you.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,599
Well, then it's lucky I ran
into you on this deserted road,

44
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,033
'cause I was about to start
asking in town where you live.

45
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,649
Okay.

46
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,483
66 South Emden Road.

47
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,579
Meet me in 15 minutes.
Do not follow me home.

48
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,547
And do not park that
in my driveway.

49
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,379
- You don't like it?
- No.

50
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,709
You got out of prison
and you bought a red car?

51
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,210
No.

52
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,723
It's not mine. It's a friend's.

53
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,590
So, what's she like now?

54
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,119
She's good.

55
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,687
She's... intense.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,713
Wonder where she gets that from.

57
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,000
You look awful.

58
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,250
Do I?

59
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,830
Because I feel great.

60
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,220
So, what happened?

61
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,093
Someone stabbed me.

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,060
Well, who?

63
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,207
I'm not sure. I never saw anyone.

64
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,547
Are you serious?

65
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,373
Do the police have any leads?

66
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,677
Not that I know of.

67
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,749
Jesus, Noah.

68
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm so sorry.

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,660
Thank you.

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,049
Are you sure you're okay?

71
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,550
Yeah, I'm fine.

72
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,439
I'm glad you're here.

73
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,769
And I... I want to
talk about everything.

74
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,603
But you have to know

75
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,359
I'm in such a precarious position.

76
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,779
Joanie's lawyer basically told me

77
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,569
that if I have anything to do
with you,

78
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,470
it will ruin my case.

79
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,800
And I'm so close
to regaining custody,

80
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,620
so... I just...

81
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,560
What are those?

82
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,510
Just muscle relaxers.

83
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,617
Looks like Vicodin to me.

84
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,143
Is your neck hurting that much?

85
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,720
Yes.

86
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,349
You have to be careful
with that stuff, Noah.

87
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,559
It's addictive.

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,060
I know.

89
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,297
You have to leave in the morning.

90
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,370
I get it.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,730
It's nice to see me just
a little bit, though, right?

93
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,350
Night.

94
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,280
Hey.

95
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,960
So, I... I have an idea.

96
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,999
Why don't we go
to Block Island for the day?

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,869
- What?
- Well, you can't be seen

98
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,170
with me here,
so let's go somewhere else.

99
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,443
No. What... are you insane?

100
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,717
That's the million-dollar
question.

101
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,759
No, I... I'm not
having eggs with you.

102
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,389
I'm not taking a stroll with you.

103
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,223
I'm... not going anywhere
with you.

104
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,980
In fact, I...

105
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,729
Can you look at this, please?

106
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,230
What is it?

107
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,749
- Divorce?
- I need you to sign those.

108
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,317
It's no-contest.

109
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,893
I told my lawyer that I don't
want anything from you.

110
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:01,127
I just want a clean slate.

111
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,990
That's a pretty big thing
to drop on me, isn't it?

112
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,877
What, you... you won't sign them?

113
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,630
I just don't think I'm ready
to give up on us yet.

114
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,199
- My God.
- What?

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,619
- You have to hide.
- Why?

116
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,409
- Quick, it's Cole.
- Fuck that.

117
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,610
- No, please, go in the back.
- I'm not hiding from him.

118
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,113
- Get out the back.
- You're my wife.

119
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:40,881
Please? Just... go.

120
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,130
Fuck.

121
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,337
Fuck. Shit.

122
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,270
Go!

123
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,330
- Hi.
- Hey.

124
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,210
Can I come in?

125
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,740
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

126
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,139
You okay?

127
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,269
Yeah, I think so. Are you?

128
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,837
No. Not really.

129
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,399
No. No, no, no, no.
Me neither, I'm...

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,899
- What were we thinking?
- Yeah, right, I know.

131
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,203
We can not do this. It's insane.

132
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:51,171
No. No, I know, um...

133
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,319
We had our chance
and we screwed it up,

134
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,869
and I am married to somebody else.

135
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,199
- I know.
- And I love Luisa.

136
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,909
She is a good woman.

137
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,919
- Okay.
- I am not gonna hurt her

138
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,087
the way that you hurt me.

139
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,879
- And what about you?
- Right.

140
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,903
You've come so far
putting your life back together.

141
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:11,671
I do not want something
like this to derail you.

142
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,139
Derail me?

143
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,849
Yeah, I-I don't want
to derail the prog...

144
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,469
What, you think
I'm gonna freak out again?

145
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,503
That's... no. I-I just...

146
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,233
I know how much work
that you've put in

147
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,559
to try to regain some order
to your thoughts.

148
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,943
What, do you think I'm crazy,
Cole?

149
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,479
No. That's not what I'm saying.

150
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,819
- Well?
- What I'm trying to say is

151
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,787
that... I'm not going
to leave Luisa.

152
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,820
I never asked you to, so...
But... but...

153
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,489
...I want what you want.

154
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,499
I want you to have joint custody
without any hiccups.

155
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,789
I want our lives to go
back to normal.

156
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,157
It's what's best for Joanie.

157
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,883
Well, you could just give me
shared custody back.

158
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,679
No. That's not how it works.

159
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,259
Well, it could be, though.

160
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,283
You could just say to the judge
at our next hearing

161
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,984
that you trust me,

162
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:00,809
and you think I'm emotionally
sound enough

163
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,843
to take care of Joanie.

164
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,700
If that's what you believe.

165
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,200
Right.

166
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,779
So, I'm healthy enough to fuck,

167
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,409
but not to be the mother
of our child.

168
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,313
There's a process in place
for a reason, Alison.

169
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:23,481
No, I understand.
Thanks for coming by.

170
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,999
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,999
- No, don't apologize.
- I am sorry.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,063
I'm just trying to do what's
best for everyone here.

173
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,031
Yeah. I know you are.

174
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,763
I care about you.

175
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,009
We're not kids anymore.
We can't...

176
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,305
Cole, I get it.

177
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,769
The other night never happened,
okay?

178
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,270
Please just go.

179
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,350
Fuck.

180
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,399
Hey, Luisa told me
that you're gonna take Joanie

181
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,633
for her birthday tomorrow.

182
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah.

183
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,869
So come by the Lobster Roll
at 3:00.

184
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,703
I'll bring her there after school.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Thank you.

186
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,883
Look, can you please
just sign the papers and go?

187
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,519
Come to Block Island with me.

188
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,875
No. I'm not going anywhere.

189
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:30,899
Just drop it.

190
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,733
If you come, I'll sign the papers.

191
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,037
I'm serious. Come on.

192
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,160
Just one day.

193
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,579
By the end of it, if you still want a
divorce, then I'll sign the papers.

194
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,119
You never have to see me again. What do
you think is gonna happen in one day?

195
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,669
I don't know. Anything can happen.

196
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,749
I'm not gonna sleep with you,
Noah.

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,850
Please. Come on, gross.

198
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,580
Come on.

199
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,049
Come on, you missed me
just a little bit.

200
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,389
Just one day.

201
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,690
Just one more day together.

202
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,809
At the end of it,
you can get back on your knees

203
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,309
and flagellate yourself
in front of Cole and Luisa...

204
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,399
God.

205
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,029
...for the rest of eternity,

206
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,597
if that's what you really want.

207
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,887
If you touch me,

208
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,667
I'll yell rape, okay?

209
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,499
Okay. But technically,

210
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,283
you're still my wife,
so that's not really...

211
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:31,251
- No.
- ...cause...!

212
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,043
Why didn't you answer
any of my letters?

213
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,983
I didn't get any while I was away.

214
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,779
Sorry.

215
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,369
Where? In the loony bin?

216
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,870
No.

217
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,647
The rehabilitation institution.

218
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,317
How did that go?

219
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,210
Fine.

220
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,750
How was prison?

221
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,633
- Whoo-hoo!
- Noah!

222
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,299
- Block Island!
- No, what are you doing?

223
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,759
- Please.
- It's called being happy.

224
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,459
- Why don't you try it?
- No. What? Get...

225
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,049
- Yahoo!
- Noah.

226
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,049
- Block Island! We love you!
- My God, no. Stop. Please.

227
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,083
- Please don't.
- Block Island, baby!

228
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,039
Noah?

229
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,540
What?

230
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,423
Get the fuck off me.

231
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,050
Please.

232
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,680
Whoo-hoo!

233
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,907
Block Island, baby!

234
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,680
My God.

235
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,810
This is nice.

236
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,950
Aren't you glad we came?

237
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,359
I'm hungry.

238
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,239
Me too. God, what a coincidence.

239
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,983
What are the chances
of us both being hungry

240
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:23,739
at the exact same time?

241
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,159
Noah, did someone stab you
in the brain?

242
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,727
That's not nice.

243
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,833
No. That's a bar.

244
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,087
Well, they might have
oyster crackers or something.

245
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,889
They got wings.

246
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,123
Teriyaki or Jamaican jerk.

247
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,730
Jerk.

248
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,070
So, what's your plan?

249
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,713
What do you mean?

250
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,209
I mean are you gonna hang out
in Montauk

251
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,709
for the rest of your life

252
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,677
hoping that Cole will stop
being such a giant dick?

253
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,509
Don't talk about him like that.

254
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,010
Okay, but...

255
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,809
...he's an asshole.

256
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,389
I'm serious. Stop.

257
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,493
I mean, who takes a child away
from their own mother?

258
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,319
Look, he didn't take her...

259
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,399
Nevermind.

260
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,689
Come on. Say it.

261
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,239
No, there's no point
talking to you.

262
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,449
Why not?

263
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,217
Because you never really hear me.

264
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,459
Cole is doing his best
in an impossible situation.

265
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,427
And I'm grateful for...

266
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,129
You're grateful?

267
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,630
Yes.

268
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,599
Look, we made a schedule
in Joanie's best interest,

269
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,700
and eventually
I'll get shared custody

270
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,890
when I'm ready.

271
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,530
Look, Cole will only ever
see you as a disaster, Alison.

272
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,659
Whatever what you do,
however competent you become,

273
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,893
you will always be
damaged goods to him.

274
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,369
If you really think he's...

275
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,113
He's ever gonna truly trust you
with Joanie,

276
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:44,014
then you're being
incredibly naive.

277
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,680
I'm just telling the truth.

278
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,389
- Maybe he's right.
- No, he's not.

279
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,090
Yeah? He's known me the longest.

280
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,053
Maybe I can't be saved.

281
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,560
Wow.

282
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,003
You're really determined
to be unhappy, aren't you?

283
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:08,359
No.

284
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,949
No, I'm determined
to take responsibility

285
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,239
for my actions, Noah...

286
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,073
something you wouldn't understand.

287
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,473
Have you seen Helen?

288
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,480
A little bit.

289
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,939
Did you ever say anything about...

290
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,840
- You know, that I was there?
- No.

291
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,069
Why didn't you just let me go
to the police?

292
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,989
Come on. Let's not go back there.

293
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,659
He was attacking me.

294
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,409
It would've been seen
as self-defense.

295
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,999
- Maybe.
- Not maybe, it's true.

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,789
Says you, Alison.
You had no proof.

297
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,493
Well, we should've tried
to tell the truth.

298
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,461
Yeah, well, we didn't.

299
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,703
It's like you wanted
to go to prison.

300
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,650
Nobody here!

301
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,440
Noah!

302
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,949
Come here, look what I found.

303
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,450
What?

304
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,280
Noah.

305
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,910
The hot tub.

306
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,999
Get down from there.

307
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,663
- You want to try it?
- No! It's not ours.

308
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:47,913
Come on. There's no one here.

309
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,709
Season's over. They're gone.

310
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,743
No. Noah, I'm leaving.

311
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,419
Why not?

312
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,879
You're trespassing.

313
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,009
For God's sake, you're on parole.

314
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,473
So I'm the one
who should be worried.

315
00:20:58,474 --> 00:20:59,809
Not you.

316
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,310
God.

317
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,980
Shit.

318
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,810
No. Don't.

319
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:09,519
Jackpot.

320
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,769
Put that back.

321
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,070
Noah, don't... You... no.

322
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,467
You used to be a lot more fun.

323
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,789
Look, why would they keep it on
if they had left for the season?

324
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,623
'Cause they're rich.

325
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,453
Rich people don't care.

326
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,879
These things are a pain
in the ass to heat anyway.

327
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,313
The Butlers keep theirs on
all winter, too.

328
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,157
Come on, Alison.

329
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,549
Can't you just relax?

330
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,253
We're basically
the only two fucking people

331
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:42,469
on the whole fucking island.

332
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,229
No, no, no, Noah, you cannot be
naked in a stranger's hot tub

333
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,010
without permission... no... God.

334
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,489
My God.

335
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,323
This is so nice!

336
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,350
God, that's good.

337
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,700
Yes!

338
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,830
Yes!

339
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,080
It's so good.

340
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,210
Okay, fine.

341
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,930
No.

342
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,979
Close your eyes.

343
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,559
No, come on. I want to watch.

344
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,127
I'm not coming in
unless you close your eyes.

345
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,340
Okay, then if I close my eyes,
it gets really dirty.

346
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,089
Fuck, can I open yet?

347
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,590
Yes. Okay.

348
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,420
Okay.

349
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,429
This is nice. It is nice.

350
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,130
You're right.

351
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,480
Cheers.

352
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,030
God.

353
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,880
What if I moved to Montauk?

354
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,000
Why?

355
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,340
To be with you.

356
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,053
No. I, I want a divorce, Noah.

357
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,349
- Come on.
- Yeah.

358
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,250
- You don't.
- Yeah.

359
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,970
I do.

360
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,390
Look.

361
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,190
I know I was a jerk, but I...

362
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,489
...I just got out of
three years in prison.

363
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,857
I don't want what I used to.

364
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,029
I just want a simple life.

365
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,029
I just want to get
back into teaching.

366
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,930
I want to live
with someone I love.

367
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,607
Raise a... a kid that's not mine.

368
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,009
All I thought about
when I was away was

369
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,910
all the time I wasted

370
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,430
just chasing the wrong things,

371
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,503
taking you for granted.

372
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,320
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

373
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,750
No. No, don't say that.

374
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,109
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

375
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,277
You're rewriting history.

376
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,697
You and I were a mistake.

377
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:49,329
- A mistake?
- Yeah.

378
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,329
Come on. You know, you fell for me

379
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,297
because you were bored

380
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,840
and you felt trapped
by Helen, your kids,

381
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,720
your fucking father-in-law.

382
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,969
And you wanted a fling,
but you chose me,

383
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,179
who had lost a child,

384
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,613
and who was so incredibly sad

385
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,073
you couldn't just abandon me,

386
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,260
so you convinced yourself
that you loved me.

387
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,689
And I convinced myself
that I loved you,

388
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,323
because I so desperately needed
someone just to take me away.

389
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,280
I used you.

390
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,767
You used me too.

391
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,490
That's what happened between us.

392
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,539
You... you really think that?

393
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,640
Yeah. I know it's true.

394
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,960
And you do too.

395
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,339
Boys, bring your stuff inside!

396
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,840
Fuck.

397
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,913
Stop! Hey, get back here!

398
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,149
I'm calling the cops!

399
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,650
No. Shit.

400
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,690
Fuck.

401
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,313
You should've seen
your fucking face.

402
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,860
Hey! Hey!

403
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,910
Fuck.

404
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,829
- My God.
- Shh, shh, shh.

405
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,330
God.

406
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,749
Assholes.

407
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,583
I'm gonna freak out.

408
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,030
I'm fucking freezing.

409
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:28,679
Fuck.

410
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,049
Let's get you inside.

411
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,753
No, look, I just want
to go home, actually.

412
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:33,254
Please.

413
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,559
- Fuck!
- What?

414
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,127
My fucking shoes. I left them.

415
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,270
Careful.

416
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,819
- No.
- Shit.

417
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,619
- Wait! Wait!
- No!

418
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,869
No, no, no, no.

419
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,770
- No!
- Hey! Please!

420
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,015
Can he come back?

421
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:00,039
No.

422
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,329
When's the next ferry?

423
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,497
That was the last one
of the day, dude.

424
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,553
I'm really sorry.

425
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,720
No.

426
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,947
Thank God. Are you open?

427
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,807
Technically, no.

428
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,997
The season ended
a few days ago, but...

429
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,620
...Ed?

430
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,629
Can we take someone in
for the night?

431
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,997
Do you have
any clothes we can borrow?

432
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,463
I'll sign the divorce papers.

433
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,943
As soon as we get home.

434
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,370
Thank you.

435
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,953
I just want to say one thing,
though.

436
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,590
I did love you.

437
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,430
Yeah, I fucked up, and maybe...

438
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,127
Maybe it was a mistake
from the start, but...

439
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,020
...it was love.

440
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,069
At least it was for me.

441
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,570
So don't...

442
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,369
...don't take it all away from me

443
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,537
by saying it wasn't real.

444
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,957
You may not want
to remember me, but...

445
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,093
...I want to remember you, okay?

446
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,430
Okay.

447
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,553
So, I still don't understand
how this is supposed to work.

448
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,009
I mean, are you just gonna
wait around

449
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,259
for Cole to finally let you have
custody of your own child back?

450
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,760
No.

451
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,139
There's a whole court procedure.

452
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,849
Which he can circumvent
if he wants to.

453
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,350
Right.

454
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,703
I left her, Noah.

455
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,163
I left her for six months. I...

456
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,487
...I'm not okay.

457
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,500
You know, I mean,
I'm trying to be, but I...

458
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,073
...I have these moments of,

459
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,343
like, such darkness.

460
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,897
I don't know
how I'll get past them.

461
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,820
I just... I seem to be
making one bad decision

462
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,820
after another.

463
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:10,959
You know, maybe it's me.

464
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,393
Maybe I'm just kidding myself

465
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,550
if I think I could
ever be a good mother.

466
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,600
My mother...

467
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,269
...she couldn't give me
everything I needed

468
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,103
'cause she was sick.

469
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,410
And as it got worse, she...

470
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,819
...I mean, she couldn't help me
with my homework.

471
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,203
She couldn't teach me
how to drive.

472
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,789
She couldn't go shopping.

473
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,623
She couldn't even...

474
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,999
...she couldn't even
make a meal for me.

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,209
But none of that mattered to me.

476
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,177
I just needed to know
she was there.

477
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,720
Look, you don't have to be
the greatest mother on Earth.

478
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,757
All you need to do for Joanie
is be there.

479
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,820
Don't ever leave her again.

480
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,490
Stay for as long
as she needs you, and...

481
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,220
...I promise you
that'll be enough.

482
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,613
I won't have anything to do
with you.

483
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,263
Did you hear anything I just said?

484
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,019
Yeah, you're telling me
that you...

485
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,387
I can't contact you anymore.

486
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,519
I don't understand.

487
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,960
How long did you
leave Joanie with...

488
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:42,344
Please, just don't judge me. Okay?

489
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:44,029
I'm not judging you.
I'm... I'm just...

490
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,319
Well, that's why you haven't
heard from me, okay?

491
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,220
I... I had to cut myself off
from... from everything.

492
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,659
I had to reevaluate everything.

493
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,169
And now that I'm back
in Montauk, I'm...

494
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,379
...I'm still getting better.

495
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,013
I'm working on myself, but I...

496
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,363
...I'm just afraid that...

497
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,883
...when you get out,
you may still think

498
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:12,251
you have me to come home to.

499
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,933
And what you're trying
to tell me is I-I-I won't?

500
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,949
What... can't we wait
until I get out?

501
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,199
It's only a few more months.

502
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,539
No.

503
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,459
It's been made very clear to me

504
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,360
that if you come
back into my life,

505
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,017
I won't regain custody of Joanie.

506
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,810
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,279
She's even hotter than I thought
she'd be in real life.

508
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,847
- What?
- Lana.

509
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,369
She reminds me

510
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,203
of the girls that we grew up with.

511
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,660
You know?

512
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,080
Hey, let it go.

513
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,250
Not your fault.

514
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,593
This place is like
a black hole for marriages.

515
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,060
Goes in, don't come out.

516
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,299
Who do you think
she's fucking now?

517
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,800
Her ex-husband?

518
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,519
Guy that she used to work for
at that restaurant?

519
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,087
What? Too soon?

520
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,270
Sorry.

521
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,263
That's what I'd be
thinking about if I was you

522
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:44,559
in this place.

523
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,546
Then again, maybe I'm not
as evolved as you are.

524
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,963
I've been meaning to ask you...

525
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,047
what are you here for?

526
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,867
What did you do?

527
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,957
I hit someone with a car.
It was an accident.

528
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,020
You killed him?

529
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,690
Yeah.

530
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,490
No.

531
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,747
People like you don't do time
for that.

532
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,663
That's weird, 'cause here you are.

533
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,420
You must be one
very unlucky motherfucker...

534
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,770
Or you're not telling me
the whole truth.

535
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,907
But I will find out. I always do.

536
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,869
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Come here! No!

537
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,699
This is exciting. Look at this.

538
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,329
It's not anything yet.
It's just notes.

539
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,709
Solloway.

540
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,210
Fuck.

541
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,350
Can I read a little bit?

542
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,509
"Jack Hunter stood poised
on the starting block,

543
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,469
his head down,
and his young muscles tense.

544
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,889
The cold, hard water
from his pre-swim shower

545
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,639
was beading on his arm hair,

546
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,473
a thousand tiny magnifying glasses

547
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,657
clinging to his skin."

548
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,020
My God.

549
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,467
I got a hard-on.

550
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,160
Swimming.

551
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,913
It's beautiful, man.

552
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,409
It's really, really beautiful.

553
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,709
Wait,

554
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,143
who's, who's Jack Hunter?

555
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,760
Nobody.

556
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,063
Just made him up.

557
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,219
I'm gonna hang onto this,
you know,

558
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,479
just make sure that it's safe.

559
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,850
Come on, John. It's just a story.
It's Gunther!

560
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,233
I'm gonna keep this.

561
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,773
If anything were to happen to you,

562
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,270
your work is safe.

563
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,869
It's my only copy.

564
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,103
It's my only fucking copy!

565
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,350
Noah?

566
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,980
- Hey.
- Hey.

567
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,427
What are you doing out here?

568
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,313
Nothing. I-I...

569
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,529
...thought I saw someone I knew.

570
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,163
Someone you knew?

571
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,787
It's 2:00 in the morning.

572
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,370
Yeah.

573
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,009
My dad died.

574
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,910
Just over a week ago.

575
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,930
He did?

576
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,059
My God, Noah. I'm so sorry.

577
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,560
No. It's okay.

578
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,390
How is it okay?

579
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,210
Well, I just meant...

580
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,083
...I don't know what I meant.

581
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,733
Did he say good-bye?

582
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,450
No.

583
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,200
What do you know about your dad?

584
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,130
I told you.

585
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,589
Nothing.

586
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,719
Athena must have some idea
who he is.

587
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,087
Nope. She says she doesn't.

588
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:11,269
How many people could she possibly

589
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,903
have been sleeping with at once?

590
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,820
Yeah. I think she's lying.

591
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,609
I actually think they were
seeing each other on and off

592
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,189
when I was younger.

593
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,957
You know, she'd leave
a week here, a week there.

594
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,003
Once she left for six months.

595
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,203
Yeah. Well, he's probably married.

596
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,209
I'm sure you could find him
if you wanted to.

597
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,549
And say what?

598
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,517
"You're a shit.
Thanks for nothing."

599
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,849
What amazes me, though,
is that I spent my whole life

600
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,389
trying not to become my mother,

601
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,623
and, um... somehow that's...

602
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,127
You haven't become her, Alison.

603
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,150
Haven't I?

604
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,210
Fires, oceans, and babies.

605
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,233
Those are the things
I could watch forever.

606
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,597
Fires, oceans, babies.

607
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,920
I don't know how you made it
through Gabriel's death.

608
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,050
I thought about it a lot
when I was away, and just...

609
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,800
29 years old,
and you lose your child.

610
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,329
No real parents,
no one to take care of you.

611
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,963
I-I don't know how you survived.

612
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,093
I didn't, really.

613
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,537
Whoever I was back then, she...

614
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,710
She died when he did.

615
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,267
No, but I, um...

616
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,103
...I did have someone
taking care of me.

617
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,370
I had Cole.

618
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,353
Did your dad leave you anything?

619
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,803
- Yeah...
- His house.

620
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,979
What? He didn't leave it to Nina?

621
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,319
Nope.

622
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,353
That's weird, isn't it?

623
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,480
Yeah, it is weird.

624
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,340
When was the last time
you were there?

625
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,829
I don't know.

626
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,463
Twenty years ago.

627
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,709
You haven't been back in 20 years?

628
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,210
Why not?

629
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,990
My mother died there.

630
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,430
Noah,

631
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,377
I-I just assumed
that she died in a hospital.

632
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,189
No, she was...

633
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,623
She was sick for a long time.

634
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,909
My dad couldn't handle it.
He basically left home.

635
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,369
And Nina got out of there

636
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,470
as soon as high school
was over, so...

637
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,757
In the end, it was just me and Ma.

638
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,540
I remember the day I heard
I got into Williams.

639
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,300
Full-ride.

640
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,630
It was the worst day of my life.

641
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,980
Why?

642
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,267
'Cause I knew I couldn't go.

643
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,313
I mean, who'd... who'd take care
of her if I was gone?

644
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,789
I hid the letter.

645
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,409
I wasn't gonna tell her, but...

646
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,999
I was gonna pretend
I didn't get in.

647
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,749
They called the school.
High school.

648
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,959
Because that's what they do
with all the scholarship kids.

649
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,327
And the principal called
my mother, and...

650
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,987
She was so excited.

651
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,380
She started to cry,
and then she...

652
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,077
Then she nearly choked
on her own...

653
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,659
Noah, I'm sorry.

654
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,760
It's a horrible disease.

655
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,303
Anyway, it was...

656
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,169
It was like a month before

657
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,603
I graduated from senior year.

658
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,967
And she told me
that she'd decided to die.

659
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,830
She was gonna... you know.

660
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,900
What?

661
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,440
What, for you?

662
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,943
Well, she never said that, but...

663
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,329
She knew about the scholarship

664
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,097
and she knew she was alone, so...

665
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,129
The problem was her hands.

666
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,630
Her... her hands?

667
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,169
Yeah, I mean, the MS,

668
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,337
it... made them so gnarled

669
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,470
that she... she couldn't open
the pill bottle.

670
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,357
She couldn't even swallow
the pills.

671
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,520
So, I...

672
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,550
So I crushed them up
for her and...

673
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,233
Mixed them with yogurt.

674
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,320
Noah.

675
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,410
And we spent the day together.

676
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,840
I read to her.

677
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,860
Just headlines
and some short stories,

678
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,297
and... her favorite poems.

679
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,353
And then she told me I'd been a...

680
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,940
Hey.

681
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,570
She told me
I'd been a wonderful son, and...

682
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,620
Then I fed the yogurt to her.

683
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,347
Like she was my child.

684
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,590
Noah, here.

685
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,010
Shh.

686
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,877
I thought about you all the time.

687
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,213
When I was in prison, I thought
about you all the time.

688
00:49:03,214 --> 00:49:05,114
I kept asking myself,

689
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,069
"What is it about her..."
about you...

690
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,570
"What...

691
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,959
You just the wrong
person at the wrong time?

692
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,129
Why did I just blow up
my whole life

693
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,089
for a girl I met at a diner?

694
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,857
Why do I still love you so much?"

695
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,543
And I never could find the answer.

696
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,887
But... but you were sitting there
talking about Gabriel,

697
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,893
and I realized...

698
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,767
You're the only person
I've ever met...

699
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,013
The only other person
I've met who...

700
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,353
Who watched someone they love die.

701
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,957
So, I'm a loser?

702
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,020
Is that it?

703
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:13,210
No, man, you... you got nothing to
do with these pages.

704
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,700
I fucked your wife this morning.

705
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,430
Fuck.

706
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,787
Just shut the fuck up.

707
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,359
- I'll fucking kill you.
- What the...

708
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,779
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

709
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,449
You fucking prick!
I'll fucking kill you!

710
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,289
- What? Seriously?
- I'll kill you!

711
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,739
- The fuck!
- You fucking asshole!

712
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,369
You're fucking going
in the hole now!

713
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:00,873
I don't fucking care!
Fuck you, bitch!

714
00:52:00,874 --> 00:52:02,249
You're going in the box!

715
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,217
I'll fucking kill you!
I don't care!

716
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,799
Stop resisting!

717
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,406
Fuck you!

718
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,090
I'll walk you out.

719
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,293
So, who is this friend
who's loaned you a car?

720
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,687
No one you know.

721
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,003
I'll leave first.

722
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,510
Fuck.

723
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,440
Fuck.

723
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:43,405
